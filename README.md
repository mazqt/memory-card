Before project was started;

For this project, I'm going to use React to create a memory game. The player will select a set and a colour of magic cards, and then be presented by 7 random cards from that set. They'll then click one of them, whereup they're presented with a new hand. They have to keep choosing cards that they haven't already picked, and if they click a card twice, they lose. Their score will be kept track of the in the corner.

Afterthoughts;
Once I had actually gotten the fetching and handling of the API data working, it was honestly rather easy. React hooks made it so much easier to deal with state, especially passing it along between components. I feel like my main file would've gotten a lot more bloated than it did if I had done it with classes. The styling is pretty simple and far from pretty, but it's still my weak side and something I'm trying to find resources on.
