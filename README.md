For this project, I'm going to use React to create a memory game. The player will select a set and a colour of magic cards, and then be presented by 7 random cards from that set. They'll then click one of them, whereup they're presented with a new hand. They have to keep choosing cards that they haven't already picked, and if they click a card twice, they lose. Their score will be kept track of the in the corner.
